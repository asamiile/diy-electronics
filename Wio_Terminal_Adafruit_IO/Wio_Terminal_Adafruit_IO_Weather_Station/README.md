# Wio Terminal Adafruit IO Weather Station

## Overview

- This project transforms the Wio Terminal into a connected weather station. It measures ambient temperature and humidity using a Grove - DHT11 sensor and visualizes the data in two ways: locally on the built-in LCD screen and remotely on an Adafruit IO dashboard.

### Features
- Real-time Display: Displays current temperature and humidity on the Wio Terminal's screen.
- IoT Cloud Integration: Publishes sensor data to Adafruit IO via the MQTT protocol for remote monitoring and data logging.
- User-Friendly Setup: Utilizes the WiFiManager library to create a configuration portal, allowing you to set up Wi-Fi credentials through a web browser without hard-coding them into the sketch.
