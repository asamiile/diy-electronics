| Data-capable USB-C cable | 1 | Power and programming |

## Development

### Hardware Development

#### Hardware and dependencies

Wio Terminal and a data-capable USB-C cable; this example uses onboard hardware and needs no external sensor wiring.

Dependencies: Arduino/Wio Terminal core.

### Software Development

#### Source files

- [Wio_Terminal_Buzzer.ino](Wio_Terminal_Buzzer.ino)

Use the Wio Terminal board package. For legacy files stored outside a matching sketch directory, follow the shared guide before compiling. These instructions describe the source; compilation and physical behavior have not been verified in this documentation update.

### Test

Verify the behavior described in Overview and the development instructions. Compilation, execution, and physical hardware checks were not performed as part of this documentation update.
